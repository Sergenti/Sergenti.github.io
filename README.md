# zombiegame
An overly ambitious HTML DOM game I code on the weekends. This is all vanilla javascript with howler.js for the audio.

# description

You are the leader of a group of survivors in the zombie apocalypse. You must send groups to scavenge the vicinity of your camp and build your camp to grow and build civilization again !

This is still in development, at what could be called an "alpha" stage.
