# zombiegame (working title)
An overly ambitious HTML DOM game I code on the weekends. This is all vanilla javascript with howler.js for the audio.

You are the leader of a group of survivors in the zombie apocalypse. You must send groups to scavenge the wasteland and build your camp to grow and build civilization again !
